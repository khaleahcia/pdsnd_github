### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States--Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
